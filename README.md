# Command to run this project

### `npm i`

### `npm start`

# Introduction

### I bascially implement all the functionalities except for the search box.
### When you drag a item into the green container, it will create a white droppable container, and you can drop the items in the white container. (which has a limit height and having scroll bar when items > 3)

### Hint!! When playing with this demo, only the `Age` `Education` `Gender` has mocked data, please don't drag the other items, otherwise it will raise an error
